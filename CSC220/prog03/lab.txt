Quick IQ test:  what's the next number in this sequence?

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ?

This is the famous Fibonacci sequence.

For this lab, you will create implementations of the Fibonacci
sequences with different running times and test your ability to
predict their running times using the O() analysis you learned in
class.

0. Test prog03.jar.

   Try different starting buttons.  Each has a different O() time:
   O(1), O(log n), O(n) and O(phi^n)

   The last one is phi to the n'th power, where

	phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2 = 1.61803399...


   **VERIFY** that the percentage error it is calculating is CORRECT.
   (Also do this for YOUR program later!)


1. Run Eclipse.  Create package prog03 and install the java files I provided.

   Implement Main.averageTime(fib, n, ncalls).

   Run Main.  You should see something like this:

prog03.ExponentialFib@3abfe836
0 0.0
1 1.0
2 1.0
3 2.0
4 3.0
5 5.0
6 8.0
7 13.0
8 21.0
9 34.0
10 55.0
n1 20 time1 31.67975600000006
c 0.002094252405529497
n2 30 estimated time 3896.352411981697
n2 30 actual time 3660.8320700000013

What the program did was use the running time on n=20 to determine the
constant and then estimate the running time for n=30.  My run was
pretty accurate, but I think I got lucky.  How did you do?


2. I picked 1000 calls for n1 and 100 calls for n2.  What numbers
   would correspond to one second of total calling time?  Don't forget
   the times are given in microseconds.  So if it takes 50
   microseconds, then you can call it 20,000 times in one second,
   right?  So how many times for the number of microseconds you got?
   Modify your program to use these numbers of calls.


3. Using the comments I provided, write Main.accurateTime(fib, n),
   which does the same thing automatically.
   Modify Main.labExperiments to call this method instead.


4. Add code to estimate how long it would take to compute fib(100).
   Would it finish running before end of lab?  If not, when will it
   finish?  


5. Implement LinearFib that computes fib(n) in O(n) time.  How?  Set
   previous=0 and current=1.  If you have the previous element and
   current element, what is the value of the next element?  Set next
   equal to that.  Now move over one: previous is current and current
   is next.  Use a loop to do this n times.  Which one do you want to
   return?

   What should the O() method return?  1, log(n), or n?


5. Switch to LinearFib in Main.  Test.


HOMEWORK DUE WEDNESDAY AT 11AM

6. Ditto LogFib.


7. Implement ConstantFib, which is just like LogFib only it calls
   Math.pow instead of the private pow.  Test its running time.


8. Fix getInteger so it does the right thing if the user enters a
   negative integer or a non-integer.  You will need to use try catch
   for the latter.  (CSC120 review.)  Test using the call from main.


9. Write a method doExperiments(Fib fib) in Main.  It should loop
   forever (while (true)...).

a. Prompt the user for an integer n using getInteger.  If it returns
  -1, meaning the user clicked CANCEL, return.

b. Call accurateTime to get the running time for fib(n).  Calculate
   the constant for the the O().

c. Display n, fib(n) (stored in fibn), the running time, and the
   constant for that O() (using sendMessage).

d. Modify main to call doExperiments(new ExponentialFib()) to test it.


10. Modify doExperiments:

a. Save the constant in a variable declared outside the loop,
   initially zero.  Before calculating the constant, check if it has
   been calculated in a previous loop (it is not zero).  If so, use
   the previous constant to estimate the current running time and
   display the estimate.  This estimate will appear in a sendMessage
   before the sendMessage in 8c.

b. Instead of displaying the new constant in the 8c sendMessage,
   display the percentage error between the estimate and the actual
   running time.


11. Write a method doExperiments() in Main.

   It should give the user the choice of testing one of the five Fib
   implementations and then call doExperiments(fib) on that one.

   Modify main to call it.


12. MysteryFib inherits ExponentialFib's O() method, but that is
    clearly wrong.  Try overriding the O() method in MysteryFib with
    different functions to figure out which one is best.  Leave the
    best one in your solution.
