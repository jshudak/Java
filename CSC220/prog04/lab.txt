If you are having any problems, draw a diagram for the TA and show him
or her what you are trying to do.  You need to figure out as much for
yourself as possible.

0. I put prog04 into your src (Box) folder.  In Eclipse, copy and
pasted Main.java from prog02 into prog04.  It should automatically put

package prog04;

at the top of Main.java, but if it doesn't, fix it.  After that, add the lines

import prog02.UserInterface;
import prog02.GUI;
import prog02.ConsoleUI;
import prog02.PhoneDirectory;

Change the initialization of pd in main to

		PhoneDirectory pd = new DLLBasedPD();


1. Read DLLBasedPD.java up to save().  In save(), fill in the missing
   parts of the output loop.


2. In add(), add the new entry to the end of the list.
   Test your program by modifying and running Main.  Add a new entry
   and make sure it appears in csc220.txt.

   When you think you have it right, run TestDLLBasedPD.javat.  find
   and remove will fail because you have not done them yet.


3. Finish find().  Test.


HOMEWORK

4. Finish removeEntry().  Remember: if the name is not there, then
   find will return null or an entry with a different name.  Test.


5. Change Main to use SortedDLLPD.  In Eclipse, create a SortedDLLPD
   class in package prog04 that extends DLLBasedPD.  Copy the
   following methods AND THEIR JAVADOC to SortedDLLPD: add and find.


6. Modify add to pay attention to the value of previousORnext.
   If it is null, adding is easy.

   If it is not null, you have to do a comparison to determine if
   previousORnext is previous or next.  Set previous or next to
   previousORnext and set next or previous using the getNext() or
   getPrevious method of DLLEntry.

   Add newEntry to the list.  Be careful: there are special cases if
   previous or next is null meaning it should be added first or last.

   Test using TestSortedDLLPD.java.  find will fail because you have
   not done it yet.

 
7. Modify find so it returns the entry just before or just after the
   name if the name isn't there.  Test.

 
8. Copy and paste TestUI from prog02.  Fix any mistakes you still have
   in Main.
