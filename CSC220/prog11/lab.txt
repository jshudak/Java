0. Create prog11.  Download Trie.java.


1. Implement toString in Trie.  You should see:

bob null null
   by bobby 0
   ca null null
     lf bobcalf 1
     t bobcat 2
catdog catdog 3

  Plus incorrect output from get.


2. Implement the recursive find.  Now containsKey and get should work.
   The ten gets I do for you should be correct.


HOMEWORK

3. Implement the recursive put.  Now put should work.  Ditto testing.


4. Implement entryList.  Now entrySet (command 5) should work.


5. Copy your solution to Jumble from last week to this package and
   change the package at the top to prog11.  Switch to your Trie.
   Test on dict.

   If you did not finish Jumble for prog10, you can finish it for half
   credit.


EXTRA CREDIT

If you scored less that 50 on a prior prog, you can earn up to 50
points by doing the following.

6. Implement remove.  The result of remove has to be the same as that
   key were never inserted at all.


You have to work on your own.  Please do not ask for the TA's help on
extra credit.
