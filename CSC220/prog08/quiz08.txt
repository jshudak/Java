FINISHED SCORE: 9/10


0. When the Jumble solver reads the word "computer" from the
   dictionary, what key and value does it use to store it in its Map?


	KEY = "cemoprtu"



	VALUE = "computer"



1. When the Jumble solver is asked to unscramble "ewting", what key
   does it look up in the Map?

	"egintw"


2. DLLMap uses a sorted linked list with first and last pointing to
   the first and last node.  If key is not present,
   DLLMap.find(startAt,key) returns a neighboring key no matter where
   startAt is the list.  If "Ann" and "Zoe" are first and last and
   startAt is Moe, which entries DLLMap.find(startAt,"Aaron") and
   DLLMap.(startAt,"Zora") return?


	DLLMap.find(startAt,"Aaron") returns "Ann"


	DLLMap.find(startAt,"Zora") returns "Zoe"


3. Suppose the Jumble solver uses DLLMap for its Map.  What is the O()
   to store one new word into the Map?  What is the O() to store all n
   words in the file into the Map?


	For one word, O(1)    -1/2  >>  linked list, everything is O(n)


	For a whole file, O(n) -1/2 >>  O(n) for n items is O(n*n), or O(n^2)



5. A SkipMap has extra "skip" lists.  A key which "flips heads" gets
   into the first skip list.  If it flips head again, it gets into the
   second skip list, and so on.  About how many skip lists do you
   expect a SkipMap with 1000 entries to have?  Why?




	log  1000 = 10
	   2




4. Pick up a coin and start flipping it.  Stop when you get the first
   heads.  How many tails do you expect to flip (flip on average)
   before you flip that heads?



	1






6. When searching for a key in a SkipMap, why do you never move past
   an entry in the third skip list if that key also appears in the
   next higher (fourth) skip list?


	The find method would have already passed gone
	past the entry in its previous recursive run
	if it needed to. It contains itself between two
	letters so this does not happen.





7. When searching for an key in a SkipMap, how many nodes do you
   expect to move past in the third skip list?  Why?


	You expect to only move only 1 time at any
	list level in Skip List.





8. Suppose the Jumble solver uses SkipMap for its Map.  What is the
   (expected) O() to store one new word into the Map?  What is the
   expected O() to store all n words in the file into the Map?


	storing one word takes O(log n) time
	

	storing all n words takes O(n logn) time



9. How much more space than DLLMap do you expect SkipMap to use?  Why?

	twice as much space because n/2 + n/4 + n/8... = n, which
	means its storing the equivilant of two lists
	(1 bottom list + 1 total storage from skipped lists)
